# Cloudflare One

Do not use this skill as product documentation. Before citing limits, settings, API fields, category IDs, or exact UI paths, retrieve current information from the [Cloudflare One docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/), the Cloudflare docs MCP server, or the Cloudflare API schema.

## Workflow

1. Classify the ask: architecture, configuration, troubleshooting, migration, or review.
2. Gather context: account ID, users/sites/apps, identity provider, SCIM/group sync, device management, traffic path, compliance constraints, and rollout blast radius.
3. Retrieve only the current docs needed for the products involved: Access, Gateway, WARP, Tunnel, Cloudflare WAN, DLP, CASB, device posture, or identity.
4. If account access is available, inspect existing resources before proposing or making changes: Access apps/policies/groups/IdPs, Gateway rules/lists/categories, device profiles/posture checks, tunnels/routes, DNS/resolver settings, and locations/sites.
5. Propose the change set with prerequisites, validation, and rollback. For risky changes, stage disabled or scoped to a pilot group/site unless the user explicitly asks otherwise.

## Assessment Prompts

Use these to avoid jumping straight to configuration. Ask only the prompts relevant to the user's task.

### Architecture and Current State

- Sites and users: offices, branches, data centers, VPCs, remote users, contractors, user counts, and current connectivity model.
- Applications and destinations: SaaS, public apps, private apps, APIs, infrastructure targets, protocols, ports, hostnames, and IP ranges.
- Connectivity: VPN, MPLS, SD-WAN, direct Internet breakout, centralized backhaul, site-to-site needs, and private DNS architecture.
- Security stack: current SWG, NGFW, VPN/ZTNA, DLP, CASB, email security, logging, and compliance requirements.
- Identity: IdP, SCIM/group sync, group naming, multi-IdP needs, service accounts, and contractor/partner access.
- Rollout: pilot users/sites, blast radius, rollback path, support owners, and success criteria.

### Access and SaaS Federation

- App shape: web app, API, SSH/RDP/VNC, database, SaaS app, public hostname, private IP, or private hostname. Retrieve [Access application type](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/choose-application-type/) docs before choosing.
- Access model: clientless browser access, WARP private access, service token access, or SaaS SSO federation.
- Policy needs: user groups, device posture, geography, session duration, mTLS, service tokens, and app launcher visibility. Retrieve [Access policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/) docs before configuring selectors or evaluation order.
- SaaS details: SAML vs OIDC support, ACS/redirect URLs, Entity IDs/client IDs, required attributes, and tenant-control requirements.

### Tunnel and Private Networking

- Sites and segments: which data centers, VPCs, offices, or network segments need connectivity.
- HA: dev/test single connector, production multiple connectors, or advanced multi-tunnel/site redundancy.
- Runtime: where cloudflared or WARP Connector will run: VM, container, Kubernetes, bare metal, or other target.
- Egress: whether connectors can reach Cloudflare over the required outbound ports/protocols. Retrieve [Tunnel connectivity prechecks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/troubleshoot-tunnels/connectivity-prechecks/) before naming exact endpoints.
- Origin reachability: whether the connector can resolve and reach every private origin.
- Routing: required CIDRs/hostnames, overlapping IP spaces, [virtual networks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/private-net/cloudflared/tunnel-virtual-networks/), [Split Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/route-traffic/split-tunnels/), and private DNS/[resolver policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/resolver-policies/) needs.
- Management model: prefer remotely managed/token-based tunnels for new deployments unless there is a clear reason for local config.

### Gateway, TLS, and DLP

- Traffic controls: DNS categories, HTTP URL/path inspection, L4 ports/protocols, egress IP requirements, custom lists, and allow/block exceptions. Retrieve [Gateway traffic policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/) docs for current selectors and order of enforcement.
- Identity: whether Gateway policies need user or group selectors, and whether users will be authenticated through WARP/IdP context. Check [Gateway identity selectors](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/identity-selectors/) and [SCIM provisioning](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/users/scim/) when groups are involved.
- TLS inspection: root CA deployment path, certificate-pinned applications, compliance exceptions, and FIPS requirements. Retrieve [TLS decryption](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/http-policies/tls-decryption/) docs before enabling.
- DLP: sensitive data types, channels to inspect, TLS inspection readiness, DLP profiles, payload logging requirements, and false-positive tolerance. Retrieve [DLP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/data-loss-prevention/) docs before creating enforcement.

### CASB, Device Posture, and Risk

- CASB: SaaS vendors, admin access level, scan policy, org size, remediation owner, and whether inline protection is also required. Retrieve [CASB findings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/cloud-and-saas-findings/manage-findings/) docs before recommending remediation.
- Device posture: required checks, third-party EDR/MDM integrations, enrollment rules, device profiles, and split tunnel alignment.
- Risk scoring: relevant behavior signals, false-positive sources such as VPNs or service accounts, and whether risk is for investigation or enforcement. Retrieve [user risk score](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/users/risk-score/) docs before using risk in policies.

### Cloudflare WAN / Site Connectivity

- Site topology, on-ramp type, route ownership, tunnel redundancy, static vs BGP-managed routes, network firewall needs, and appliance/profile ownership. Retrieve [Cloudflare WAN](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/) and [Cloudflare Network Firewall](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-network-firewall/) docs before proposing site connectivity changes.

## Guardrails

- Access controls application authorization; Gateway controls traffic inspection/filtering. Use both when the requirement spans identity-aware app access and network/web security.
- Public hostname Access apps can be clientless. Private destination apps require WARP or another network on-ramp plus routes and DNS resolution. Retrieve [self-hosted private app](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/non-http/self-hosted-private-app/) docs before configuring private destinations.
- Cloudflare Tunnel is an off-ramp from a private network to Cloudflare. Cloudflare WAN/site connectivity is not a drop-in replacement for per-user application access.
- Group-based policies depend on IdP group claims or SCIM. If group sync is missing, do not invent group selectors.
- Private hostnames need explicit DNS routing/resolution; creating an Access app alone is not enough. Use [resolver policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/resolver-policies/) or [Local Domain Fallback](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/route-traffic/local-domains/) based on where the resolver is reachable.
- HTTP inspection and DLP for encrypted web traffic require TLS inspection and planned Do Not Inspect exceptions.
- Gateway DNS, Network, HTTP, and Egress policies have different evaluation semantics. Retrieve [order of enforcement](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/order-of-enforcement/) docs before explaining precedence.
- Start broad block/allow/DLP/TLS policies disabled, in audit, or limited to a pilot unless the user approves a wider rollout.

### Identity and Access

- Access Groups are Cloudflare objects; IdP/SCIM groups are identity claims. Gateway group selectors use synced IdP groups, not Access Groups.
- Group names and SAML/OIDC attributes are case-sensitive. Verify exact claim names and values before creating group-based rules.
- SCIM changes and group membership can be stale until sync and re-authentication complete. Troubleshoot with the user's last authenticated identity, not just the IdP state.
- Access policies are default-deny. A private app with routes but no Allow policy still blocks access.
- Access policy selectors can use IP lists, not Gateway domain or URL lists.
- SaaS federation handles authentication into the SaaS app. SaaS authorization and tenant restrictions usually require SaaS-side roles and/or Gateway tenant controls.
- Browser Rendering for SSH/VNC/RDP is an Access capability. Browser Isolation renders general web content remotely. Do not conflate them.

### Private Networking

- Split tunnel mode changes the meaning of every route decision: Exclude mode sends traffic to Cloudflare when removed from excludes; Include mode sends traffic only when added to includes.
- Virtual networks must be assigned consistently to tunnel routes and the WARP device profile. One side alone creates unreachable routes.
- CIDR routes and hostname routes solve different problems. Hostname routes still need DNS resolution through resolver policies or Local Domain Fallback.
- A healthy tunnel only proves cloudflared can reach Cloudflare. The connector must also resolve and reach the private origin.
- Run multiple cloudflared connectors for production HA, preferably on separate hosts. Token-based, remotely managed tunnels are the default for new deployments.

### Gateway, TLS, and DLP

- `dns.domains` matches a domain and subdomains; `dns.fqdn` is exact-match only.
- DNS pre-resolution selectors and post-resolution selectors do not behave like a single strict precedence list. Retrieve current evaluation docs before changing rule order.
- HTTP Do Not Inspect rules run before HTTP Allow/Block/Isolate behavior. A later block rule will not override an earlier inspection bypass.
- Certificate-pinned apps need Do Not Inspect exceptions before broad TLS inspection. Deploy the Cloudflare root CA to managed devices before enabling inspection.
- DLP profiles are detection definitions only. They do nothing until referenced by Gateway HTTP policies or CASB scan settings.
- Start DLP with monitoring/payload logging where appropriate, tune false positives, then block.
- Gateway Network policies are strict L4 controls. Identity-aware L4 matching requires authenticated WARP context.

### CASB, Risk, and Operations

- API CASB is out-of-band and periodic. It does not provide real-time inline enforcement; use Gateway/DLP/tenant controls for inline protection.
- CASB findings are tied to specific assets and instances. Drill into affected assets before recommending remediation.
- Use current Dashboard remediation guidance for CASB fixes. Most remediations happen in the SaaS admin console, not Cloudflare.
- Large SaaS integrations can take 24-48 hours for initial scans. Reauthorizing can restart scan state; check credential health before reconnecting.
- User risk scores are behavior-based and asynchronous. CASB findings do not automatically imply high user risk.

### Cloudflare WAN / Site Connectivity

- Cloudflare WAN is connectivity, not a security service. Apply inspection and policy with Gateway/network firewall where required.
- WAN firewall expressions are not the same language as Gateway wirefilter expressions. Retrieve the current syntax before editing.
- Generated IPsec PSKs and some OAuth/client secrets are returned once. Store them immediately.

## Output Defaults

- Designs: current assumptions, target architecture, product responsibilities, rollout phases, validation, and open decisions.
- Configuration work: prerequisites, exact resources to inspect/create/change, test cases, and rollback.
- Troubleshooting: traffic path, likely failure point, evidence to collect, and next test.

## Validation Prompts

- Access: test authorized, unauthorized, posture-failing, service-token, and multi-IdP flows when applicable; inspect logs and policy precedence.
- Private network access: verify route lookup, tunnel health, origin reachability, split tunnel behavior, DNS resolution, and end-to-end access from a WARP test device.
- Gateway: verify rule type, action, traffic expression, precedence/evaluation phase, referenced lists, and Gateway settings before enabling broadly.
- TLS/DLP: test Do Not Inspect exceptions and root CA trust before enabling inspection; test DLP with known samples and monitor false positives before blocking.
- CASB/risk: confirm integration health, credential expiry, asset discovery, scan timing, finding instances, and risk-score signal latency before declaring remediation complete.
- Cloudflare WAN: verify tunnel health, route priority/ownership, traffic flow, firewall expression syntax, and connector/appliance telemetry where applicable.

## API Safety

- Use fully qualified MCP tool names when MCP tools are available.
- Never guess category IDs, application IDs, wirefilter fields, or API request bodies. Retrieve the current schema/docs and existing account objects.
- Do not enable broad production policies without explicit approval.
